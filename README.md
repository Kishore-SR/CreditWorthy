## CreditWorthy üèõÔ∏è

CreditWorthy is a web app designed to assess the creditworthiness of unbanked nano-entrepreneurs, such as local vegetable vendors, laundry service providers, and kirana store owners. 

This project was created for the **AI & Data Science Codeathon 2024**, a 24-hour hackathon organized by RBIHub, IIITB Innovation Center, in collaboration with Candara Bank, held on **20-21 November 2023**.

### Features
- **AI-Based Credit Scoring**: Uses AI to evaluate creditworthiness based on transaction patterns, business performance, and other alternative data.
- **Simple Authentication**: Users authenticate via phone number to easily access the platform.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Minimal data collection for accurate and efficient credit scoring.
- **Financial Inclusion**: Helps nano-entrepreneurs access formal credit, enabling business growth and economic empowerment.
